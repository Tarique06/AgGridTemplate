- **Target**: ES2022 for modern JavaScript features
- **Development**: Hot reload and source maps enabled

## Key Components

### Main Application Component (`app.component.ts`)
- Standalone Angular component serving as the root
- Manages employee data display and grid interactions
- Handles grid events (row selection, cell clicks, grid ready)
- Implements responsive design with flexbox layout

### Employee Model (`employee.interface.ts`)
- TypeScript interface defining employee data structure
- Fields: id, fullName, age, country, department
- Provides type safety throughout the application

### Grid Configuration

## Data Flow

1. **Data Loading**: Static employee data is loaded in the component
2. **Grid Initialization**: AG Grid is configured with column definitions and options
3. **User Interactions**: Grid handles sorting, filtering, and selection
4. **Event Handling**: Component responds to grid events (row selection, cell clicks)
5. **UI Updates**: Reactive updates based on user interactions

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Standalone Components
- **Problem**: Traditional NgModules add complexity for simple applications
- **Solution**: Angular standalone components for simpler architecture
- **Benefits**: Reduced boilerplate, better tree shaking, easier testing

### Why AG Grid Community
- **Problem**: Need for advanced data grid functionality
- **Solution**: AG Grid Community edition for enterprise-grade features
- **Benefits**: Professional data grid with sorting, filtering, pagination out-of-the-box
- **Trade-off**: Larger bundle size, but significant functionality gain

### Why Client-Side Data Management
- **Problem**: No backend requirements specified
- **Solution**: Static data with client-side operations
- **Benefits**: Simple deployment, fast interactions, no server dependencies
- **Limitation**: Not suitable for large datasets or real-time updates

### Styling Approach
- **Problem**: Need for professional appearance with grid integration
- **Solution**: AG Grid Alpine theme with custom CSS overrides
- **Benefits**: Consistent look, responsive design, accessibility features
